  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nposix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()\n\nIf an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and\ncalls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can be reaped by its parent\nor debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().\n\nIf a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be\nable to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or\nlock_task_sighand() will fail.\n\nAdd the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.\n\nThis fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because\nexit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). But the check still\nmakes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail\nanyway in this case.",

        "description": "This attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks) in order to write to sensitive files. An attacker can create a Symlink link to a target file not otherwise accessible to them. When the privileged program tries to create a temporary file with the same name as the Symlink link, it will actually write to the target file pointed to by the attackers' Symlink link. If the attacker can insert malicious content in the temporary file they will be writing to the sensitive file by using the Symlink. The race occurs because the system checks if the temporary file exists, then creates the file. The attacker would typically create the Symlink during the interval between the check and the creation of the temporary file."

        "description": "This attack targets a race condition occurring between the time of check (state) for a resource and the time of use of a resource. A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."
