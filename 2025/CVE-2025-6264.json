  "name": "",
  "description": "Velociraptor allows collection of VQL queries packaged into Artifacts from endpoints. These artifacts can be used to do anything and usually run with elevated permissions.Â  To limit access to some dangerous artifact, Velociraptor allows for those to require high permissions like EXECVE to launch.\n\nThe Admin.Client.UpdateClientConfig is an artifact used to update the client's configuration. This artifact did not enforce an additional required permission, allowing users with COLLECT_CLIENT permissions (normally given by the \"Investigator\" role) to collect it from endpoints and update the configuration. \n\nThis can lead to arbitrary command execution and endpoint takeover.\n\nTo successfully exploit this vulnerability the user must already have access to collect artifacts from the endpoint (i.e. have the COLLECT_CLIENT given typically by the \"Investigator' role).",

        "description": "In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."

        "name": "Directory Indexing",
        "description": "An adversary crafts a request to a target that results in the target listing/indexing the content of a directory as output. One common method of triggering directory contents as output is to construct a request containing a path that terminates in a directory name rather than a file name since many applications are configured to provide a list of the directory's contents when such a request is received. An adversary can use this to explore the directory tree on a target as well as learn the names of files. This can often end up revealing test files, backup files, temporary files, hidden files, configuration files, user accounts, script contents, as well as naming conventions, all of which can be used by an attacker to mount additional attacks."

Additionally, writing malicious data to log files may target jobs, filters, reports, and other agents that process the logs in an asynchronous attack pattern. This pattern of attack is similar to \"Log Injection-Tampering-Forging\" except that in this case, the attack is targeting the logs of the web server and not the application."
