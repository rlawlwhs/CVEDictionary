  "name": "",
  "description": "Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Prior to version 1.11.11, using the /locales/locale.json with the locale and namespace query parameters, a malicious actor is able to execute arbitrary code without being authenticated. With the ability to execute arbitrary code it could be used to gain access to the Panel's server, read credentials from the Panel's config, extract sensitive information from the database, access files of servers managed by the panel, etc. This issue has been patched in version 1.11.11. There are no software workarounds for this vulnerability, but use of an external Web Application Firewall (WAF) could help mitigate this attack.",

When the executable loads the resource (such as an image file or configuration file) the attacker has modified the file to either execute malicious code directly or manipulate the target process (e.g. application server) to execute based on the malicious configuration parameters. Since systems are increasingly interrelated mashing up resources from local and remote sources the possibility of this attack occurring is high."

An adversary can override variables leveraging user-supplied, untrusted query variables directly used on the application server without any data sanitization. In extreme cases, the adversary can change variables controlling the business logic of the application. For instance, in languages like PHP, a number of poorly set default configurations may allow the user to override variables."
